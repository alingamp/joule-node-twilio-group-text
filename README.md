Group Text Message Chat Channel Using Twilio
This Joule is an out-of-the box group text message chat channel app which can be easily set up with your Twilio account.

Give your Twilio number to anyone you'd like to join and they'll be able to join or leave at their discretion. Upon joining the chat everyone will receive a welcome message with a list of everyone already in the chat. Anytime someone new joins or someone leaves a message is sent to the group as well.

As the administrator you'll have the ability to ban someone from the channel. You'll also be able to deactivate and reactivate the room at any time.

What you'll need
* A Twilio Account (you can set this up later)
* A text message capable cell phone
* Friends
